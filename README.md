# Primer React App ⚛️⚡

The easiest way to build an app from scratch with [Primer React](https://primer.style/react/) and deploy with GitHub Pages. 

Accessible only for signed-in Hubbers out of the box! Perfect for quick prototyping ⚡

## Get Started (Locally)

### Start your repository
1. Create a repository for your prototype by clicking **Use this template** > **Create a new repository**

2. Set the repository Owner as **github** so that the deployment is only enabled for Hubbers. Choose whatever name you want.

3. Clone your new repo locally

### Building your prototype

You need to have nodejs installed on your machine. If you don't, [head here](https://nodejs.org/en/download) and choose macOS installer.

Once you have the repository cloned on your machine, open the folder on VSCode or the terminal and run:

```bash
npm install
```

```bash
npm run dev
```

You will see the site running on http://localhost:1234

### Deploy
