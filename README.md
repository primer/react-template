## Get Started (Codespaces)

1. Click `Code`
2. Click `new codespace`
3. Pick any machine type and click `create codespace`
4. Wait until the container is built and `Running postCreateCommand...` is finished running in the bottom `TERMINAL` panel.
5. Now in the `TERMINAL` panel write the `yarn start` command and hit enter.
6. When it's finished building your project click `Open` to open a preview of it. If this doesn't happen click `PORTS` in the bottom window and open the `Local Address` from there.
7. Now you are in Mona's playground 🎉 and you can start editing the `src/Playground.js` file to play around with Primer React.
